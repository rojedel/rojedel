### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is **Edgardo Rojas**, 

I am a Mechanical Engineer who loves to dig into the data to find answers to my endless curiosity and I'm making the transition to becoming a full time data analyst. I've completed the **Google Data Analytics Course**, worked with tools such as **R** and **Python** to get a handle on big data, **SQL** to create and modify databases and **Tableau** to make crisp visualizations to help drive the point home, some of which, are available to look at in my portfolio!

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on multiple exciting data projects, where developing an ETL is one of them!
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning and getting better with multiple python libraries.
